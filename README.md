# Learning about Stacks and Queues
In this project,
  1. Together, we will write an implementation for a stack.
  2. Together, we will test our implementation for a stack.
  3. With a partner, you will write and test an implementation for a queue.
  4. Together, we will pseudocode how to tackle the job-simulation problem identified below.
  5. (OPTIONAL) On your own, you should use your implementation of stack and queue to code a solution to the job-simulation problem.
